# recursion-review
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## Goals
- Gain exposure and comfort with pair programming by tasking the pair to work on exercises previously completed individually, emphasizing good coding and pair programming practices.
